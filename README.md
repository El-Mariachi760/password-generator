Password Generator for the masses

Here is my password generator and I did the follwing:

- Every time the 'generate password' button is clicked, it will prompt to insert a number of characters, followed by if you want upper, lower, special, numbers in it
- utilized the charcode to call on upper, lower, special, and number characters rather than creating array for each individual character
- Decided to put the number of characters in the beginning because is it more user friendly 

Here is a screenshot of the generator along with the link:
